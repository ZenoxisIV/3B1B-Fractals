## About the Project
This [CS 136](https://dcs.upd.edu.ph/academics/undergraduate-program/) project is inspired by the educational content of the renowned YouTube channel, [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RdOwhmqP5s). Through this project, our goal is to bring appreciation to the beauty and complexity of fractal geometry.
